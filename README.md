# Birth-Day-webiste
surprise birthday card

This project is a personalized birthday surprise webpage designed to celebrate a loved one's special day. Upon visiting the page, a heart-shaped animation floats across the screen, setting a festive mood. Clicking the "Open" button initiates a countdown from three, leading to a virtual birthday cake with a candle. Users can interact by clicking the candle to "blow it out," which transitions the page to display a celebratory message and an image of a cut cake. The design incorporates a pink gradient background, playful animations, and engaging interactions to create a memorable online birthday experience.
